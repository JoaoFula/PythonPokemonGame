# PythonPokemonGame

I'd like to thank badcodinghabits on youtube for getting me started in this project.

I do not have ownership on any of the sprites used.
I thank nintendo for the pokemon sprites and the artists at: [fav.me/d6321qy] for the tileset.

This project has no commercial purpose and it is only meant for learning.

To run this project it is necessary to have python3 and pygame installed.
Run by typing "python3 main.py"
